# SLSA L2 Demo with Tekton
This repo shows how Tekton can be used to achieve SLSA L2 requirements.

### To run the demo
* Clone the repo.
* Edit env.sh to add appropriate values for running the demo.
* Run setup.sh which sets up the environment.
* Run run_pipeline.sh.
* After the pipeline run is done run provenance_extractor.sh

### How the demo works
#### setup.sh

setup.sh based on the settings specified in env.sh, sets up
* Creates a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud.
* Sets up Artifact registry on Google Cloud.
* Sets up the KMS on Google Cloud.
* Sets up the necessary Service Accounts.
* Installs Tekton Pipelines and Tekton Chains on the Kubernetes cluster.

#### run_pipeline.sh
run_pipeline.sh first replaces the ENV variables in pipeline_run.yaml with their values defined in env.sh and then runs pipeline_run.yaml.

#### provenance_extractor.sh
provenance_extractor.sh extracts the provenance and stores it in the file provenance.
